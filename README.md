A chrome extension for playing YouTube videos simultaneously on two computers

As a small project, I've been working on a chrome extension to play a video simultaneously on two different computers. I Skype a lot with my family and sometimes we want to watch a comedy sketch or music video at the same time but are too lazy to use one of the websites that currently do this. While the extension only works between two users at the moment, I wanted to allow the extension to be able to eventually grow into something that could connect groups of clients. It uses a simple Java Server with a Java implementation of Socket.io.
Any advice on how I could expand/fix/improve it or people wanting to contribute would be awesome.


##### How to Use:
Open a YouTube tab and you will find a WeTube Icon in your search bar. Click the icon and enter a username. You will then need to enter a user ID and Key of the target computer. If you have multiple YouTube tabs open right click anywhere on the one you want to share and use the WeTube context menu to share that tab.

##### Planned Features: 
- [x] Send URL to connected client~~s~~
- [ ] Connect to multiple users
- [ ] Allow user to choose what parts of video should be shared (Audio, playspeed, videosize)
- [ ] Share entire YouTube page
